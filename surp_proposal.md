# Introduction
## Background Information

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that affects the production of the hormone insulin in the pancreas. For the most part, type 1 diabetics produce no insulin at all. 

Insulin is a hormone which promotes the absorption of glucose into the liver, muscle, and fat cells of the body. The action of insulin in the bloodstream causes glucose in the blood to pass into the cells, enabling the energy within to be harnessed by the body.

For healthy individuals, insulin is produced in the pancreas, according to the

Without insulin producing cells, however, type 1 diabetics currently must dose insulin according to their measured blood sugar.
